# Vehicular Perception Based on Inertial Sensing - A Structured Mapping of Approaches and Methods

In this paper, we present a structured literature mapping of the state-of-the-art vehicle perception produced through inertial sensors and Artificial Intelligence techniques. We describe a structured, approach, and technologies-oriented panorama of this field.
