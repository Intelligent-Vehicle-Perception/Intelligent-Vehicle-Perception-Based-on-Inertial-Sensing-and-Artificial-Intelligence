# Intelligent Vehicle Perception Based on Inertial Sensing and Artificial Intelligence
This project aims to develop solutions for vehicular perception through inertial sensor signals and Artificial Intelligence models. Vehicular perception comprises exteroception and proprioception. Exteroception aims to understand the environment outside the vehicle, recognizing the road features on which it travels. These features include transient events in the form of anomalies and obstacles, such as potholes, cracks, speed bumps, etc.; and persistent events, such as surface type, conservation condition, and the road surface quality. On the other hand, proprioception aims to understand vehicular movements to identify their own behavior. These identifications can also be transient in the form of driving events, such as lane change, braking, skidding, aquaplaning, turning right or left; and persistent, as a safe or dangerous driving behavior profile. This situational information (perceptions) has wide applicability in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.

For the development of this project, we collect nine datasets using GPS, camera, inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes), magnetometer, and temperature sensor. These data were produced with contextual variations including three different vehicles, driven by three different drivers, traveling through three different environments. To recognize and classify the vehicular perception patterns, we have developed several models based on Artificial Intelligence, among Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches. Below we describe the datasets produced, models developed and the results obtained, together with published scientific papers and source-codes.

#### [Road Surface Type Classification Based on Inertial Sensors and Machine Learning: A Comparison Between Classical and Deep Machine Learning Approaches For Multi-Contextual Real-world Scenarios](https://github.com/Intelligent-Vehicle-Perception/Road-Surface-Type-Classification-1)
In this research, we developed models for the road surface type classification, classifying between segments of dirt, cobblestone, and asphalt roads. We applied classical techniques of K-Means Clustering (KMC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN); and Deep Learning techniques based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), and hybrid LSTM-CNN. We analyzed in the time domain the data collected near and below the suspension, in addition to the impact of the data window size. We also evaluate the generability of model learning for unknown contexts, such as an unknown car, driver, or environment.<br>

## Passive Vehicular Sensors Dataset (PVS)

The nine datasets collected are available for download at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jefmenegazzo/pvs-passive-vehicular-sensors-datasets) and [Arquivos UFSC](https://arquivos.ufsc.br/d/55ee83c2c9d647eaa252/?p=/&mode=grid). To collect and preprocess the raw data that resulted in the PVS datasets, the following projects were used:

- [MPU-9250 Sensors Data Collect](https://github.com/Intelligent-Vehicle-Perception/MPU-9250-Sensors-Data-Collect)
    - Source-code used to manipulate the sensors in the data collection.

- [MPU-9250 and GPS Raw Data Pre-Processing](https://github.com/Intelligent-Vehicle-Perception/MPU-9250-and-GPS-Raw-Data-Pre-Processing)
    - Source-code used for initial adjustments to inertial sensor raw data, such as combining with GPS data and creating data class labels.

- [MPU-9250 Data Plot Video Creator](https://github.com/Intelligent-Vehicle-Perception/MPU-9250-Data-Plot-Video-Creator/)
    - Source-code to create videos with data plot of speed and signals from inertial sensors.

For data collection, we use several passive approach sensors, detailed in the following table:

|      Hardware     |     Sensor    |                   Data                  | Sampling Rate |
|:-----------------|:-------------|:---------------------------------------|:-------------|
| HP Webcam HD-4110 | Camera        | 720p Video                              |     30 Hz     |
| Xiaomi Mi 8       | GPS           | Speed in m/s, latitude, longitude, etc. |      1 Hz     |
| MPU-9250          | Accelerometer | 3-axis acceleration in m/sÂ²             |     100 Hz    |
| MPU-9250          | Gyroscope     | 3-axis rotation rate in deg/s           |     100 Hz    |
| MPU-9250          | Magnetometer  | 3-axis ambient geomagnetic field in ÂµT  |     100 Hz    |
| MPU-9250          | Temperature   | Sensor temperature in â—¦C                |     100 Hz    |

All the hardware equipment was attached to the vehicle as shown in the next figure. The camera was placed on the outside car roof (1), and the GPS receiver was placed internally on the dashboard (2). Two networks with MPU-9250 modules were distributed in the vehicle to get data coming from different points. Thus, each end of the front axle (right and left side) received one of the sensor networks, where a module was attached to the control arm (4), located below and near to the vehicleâ€™s suspension system; another module was placed above and near the suspension system, attached to the body immediately above the tire (3); and a third module was attached to the vehicleâ€™s dashboard  (2), inside the cabin.

The data were produced in three different vehicles, with three different drivers, in three different environments in which there are three different surface types, in addition to variations in conservation state and presence of obstacles and anomalies, such as speed bumps and potholes. The following table details the data collection contexts.
